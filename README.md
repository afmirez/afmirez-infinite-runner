# afmirez-infinite-runner

Simple endless runner built with **vanilla JS**, **Vite**, and **Kaplay**.

## 🎮 About

Play as **Andres** and run as far as you can before getting caught.  

The game is a small portfolio showcase with light satire on what I _don’t_ look for in a job:

- 🧟 **Recruiter Zombie** – endless interviews and lowball offers.
- 🍕 **Pizza Zombie** – shallow “pizza party” perks instead of real appreciation.
- 🏢 **Office Building Zombie** – the loss of flexibility with mandatory office life.

What I do value: **respect, learning, remote work, collaboration, and real growth**.

## 🕹 Controls

- **Jump:** `Space / ↑ / W / Tap`
